This work extends our preliminary work in the attached ICPR 2012 paper
by revising the experiments with more accurate measures that directly
correspond to the original works by Mikolajczyk et al. (affecting 
especially to the descriptor evaluation), introducing the coverage-N
performance measure and, in particular, providing two important
findings: with object class instances the number of matching regions
is very low, only a few as compared to hundreds in the original work,
and significant improvement can be achieved by counting more than one,
even as few as 5, best matches. The last two findings did not appear
in the ICPR work at all and thus may have given misleadingly positive
picture of the descriptors in object class level matching.
