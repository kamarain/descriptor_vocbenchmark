Mikolajczyk's detector evaluation is extended to visual object class repeatibility

Mikolajczyk's descriptor evaluation is extended to the case of object classes

A new performance measure, match coverage, is proposed for the descriptor evaluation

Instead of a single best match, the effect of multiple best matches is investigated

An important finding of descriptor matching collapse with object classes is revealed
