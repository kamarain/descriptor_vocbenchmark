This does not exist here, but we consider our ICPR 2012
publication as report1 (note that the first publication is
actually Ville Kangas Master thesis available at the
MVPR Web site (Lappeenranta University of Technology):

Lankinen, J.; Kangas, V.; Kamarainen, J.-K..
A comparison of local feature detectors and descriptors for visual object categorization by intra-class repeatability and matching,
In 21th Int. Conf. on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012), Tsukuba Science City, Japan, 2012.

[report2]
First time submitted to Pattern Recognition Letters using Anders' new
evaluation measure for descriptors (ellipse overlap as in the original
Mikolajczyk's paper).

All experiments re-run using new code by Joni (cleaned all stupid
sub-functions and made easier to understand and debug). Added also
new descriptors based on experiences from other projects.

Planning to submit to IEEE-TIP or IVC
